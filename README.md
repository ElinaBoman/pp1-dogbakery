## Design

The main goal with the design of this website was to make it look fun and inviting. By using Balsamic Wireframe the basic structure of Dog Barkery was created. The pictures in the website that has been used are fun to look at but also clean and colorful. The dotted background was choosen because it had a very nice color palette and the dots matched the over all circle style of the website. A couple of divs along with all pictures were put inside circles. This was done to make the website playful and easy on the eye.

## Testing

The website has been tested with Google DevTools. Different screen sizes has been tested to work on all devices. Functions of navbar has been adjusted to act as a toggle-bar on smaller devices, while on big screens it appers in the header to the right.

The testing with Google DevTools has helped to localise problems with responsiveness. To solve these problems, media queries has been used for devices with (min-width: 768px) and (min-width: 900px).

There are some estetic malfunctions with the toggle-bar. On smaller screens, when the toggle-menu is clicked, the menu takes up to much space on the left side. This issue will be fixed with adding some padding on the left side. The malfunction is under process.

### Validator Testing
