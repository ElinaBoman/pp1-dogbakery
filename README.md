## Design
The main goal with the design of this site was to make it look fun and inviting. The pictures that has been used are fun to look at but are also clean and colorful. The  dotted background was choosen because it had a very nice color palette and the dots matched the over all circle style of the site. Some divs and all pictures were put inside circles. This was done to make the site playful and easy on the eye. How to make the circles was learned from the Love running project at Code Institute.
