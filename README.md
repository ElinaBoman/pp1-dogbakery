## Design

The main goal with the design of this site was to make it look fun and inviting. The pictures that has been used are fun to look at but are also clean and colorful. The dotted background was choosen because it had a very nice color palette and the dots matched the over all circle style of the site. Some divs and all pictures were put inside circles. This was done to make the site playful and easy on the eye. How to make the circles was learned from the Love running project at Code Institute.

## Testing

The site has been tested with Google DevTools. Different screen sizes has been tested to work on all devices. Functions of navbar has been adjusted to act as a toggle-bar on smaller devices, while on big screens it appers in the header to the right.

The testing with Google DevTools has helped to localise problems with responsivness. To solve this problems media queries has been used for devices with (min-width: 768px) and (min-width: 900px).

There are some estetic malfunctions with the toggle bar. On smaller screens when the toggle menu is clicked the menu takes up to much space on the right side. This problem will be fixed with adding some padding on the right side. The malfunction is still being investegated.
