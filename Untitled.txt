                   <p>Here our favorite guests are dogs! And our main goal is to spoil dogs with treats, play and toons of love! 
                    We have a wide selection of treats, produced in our own bakery!
                    All of our products are fresh and without preservatives. </p>

                        <h5>But who are we?</h5>
                        <p> My name is Elina and I'm the founder of Dog Barkery and happy owner of my amazing dog Lou!
                        A few years ago Lou got really sick from being allergic to storebought treats and food. That's when the dream of a dog bakery started growing. A few years later the Dog Barkery opend its door for the first time. Today we are happy to present our additional activity center! 
                        We went from being just a small company to having one of the biggest dog bakerys in the world. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
            
                    <p> During the week we organize different activities for you and your dog. How about nosework? Or maybe try our agility course? 
                    Check out our weekly schedule bellow and follow our social medias where we keep you up to date with all of our awsome activities!</p>
